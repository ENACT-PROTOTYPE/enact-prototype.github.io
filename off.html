              <p>The NDA supports improvement in the quality of diabetes care by enabling participating NHS services and organisations to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assess local practice against NICE guidelines</li>
                    <li>Compare their care and care outcomes with similar services and organisations</li>
                    <li>Identify gaps or shortfalls that are priorities for improvement</li>
                    <li>Identify and share best practice</li>
                    <li>Provide comprehensive national pictures of diabetes care and outcomes in England and Wales</li>
                </ul
                <p>Through participation in the audit, local services are able to benchmark their performance and identify where they are performing well and improve the quality of treatment and care they provide.</p>
